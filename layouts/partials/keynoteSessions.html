					<h2>Keynote I: Who Are You? New Approaches for Authentication in Smart Spaces</h2>
					<p style="font-size:120%">
						<b>Abstract</b>: <br>
                        Smart environments are increasingly offering a range of personalised services which require knowing the identity of the person currently using the space. Widely used authentication methods including fingerprint and face recognition have been shown to be vulnerable. In the first part of this talk, we present a human identification mechanism called Vein‐ID, that uses the vein pattern of an individual's hand dorsum recorded using an off‐the‐shelf depth camera. Vein-ID extracts vein patterns using the depth information and infrared images. Two deep learning models are presented for precisely identifying a target individual from a set of enrolled users. We demonstrate using a comprehensive data set of approximately 17,500 images from 35 subjects that Vein-ID can identify an individual with an average accuracy of over 99%. In the second part of this talk, we show that WiFi signals can be used to uniquely identify people. There is strong evidence that suggests that all humans have a unique gait. An individual’s gait will thus create unique perturbations in the WiFi spectrum. We propose a system called Gate-ID that analyses the channel state information from ambient WiFi signals to extract unique features that are representative of that individual's gait. Gate-ID uses a novel attention-based deep learning model that fuses various weighted features and ignores ineffective noise to uniquely identify individuals. We implement Gate-ID on commercial off-the-shelf devices and demonstrate that it can uniquely identify individuals with average accuracy of 90.7% to 75.7% from a group of 6 to 20 people, respectively. Both systems are resilient to attacks. Unlike other physical biometric identifiers, surreptitiously capturing an individuals's vein pattern is difficult. Furthermore, mimicking an individual's walking style is equally hard. <br>

                        <b>Abstract</b>: <br>
                        In this talk, we will discuss recent work in applying techniques from 'functional analysis', which treats observed time-series as functions, allowing us to compute summary statistics of time-series for applications in health and wellness promotion using wearables. Functional analysis methods provide a principled way to reduce variability associated with human movement, and make downstream machine-learning more accurate and stable. to variables such as time-series windowing, time-warping, and intrinsic movement variability. We also provide new advances where these methods have been integrated as layers within deep-networks. We have applied these methods for activity recognition problems from wearables, activity recognition from RGB-D devices, and also recently for street-segment level analysis of bike-ridership from the Strava app.

					<h2>Invited Talk I: The Fabric of Light</h2>

                        Dr Murali Poduval. MS ( Orthopedics) DNB ( Orthopedics) PGDM is a Orthopedic Surgeon and Senior Consultant at Tata Consultancy Services working on Lifesciences Engineering. He is based on Mumbai, India
                        <b>Abstract</b>: <br>
                        Orthopedics deals with treatment of bone and joint ailments. The science of orthopedics is closely related to the science of engineering, requiring intimate knowledge of not only physics and mechanics but also metallurgy. It is not surprising , therefore that orthopedics has seen the application and also adoption of technology in an attempt to improve practice and outcomes. Image guided surgery, novel implants, navigation and robotics are some of the examples that one may quote. Wearable technology has a large potential in this field. There have been reports over the last two decades of potential application of wearable technology in various aspects of orthopedic surgery , some of these being sports medicine, joint replacement and spine surgery. The availability of better sensing technology and the ability to apply better ways of analyzing and deriving insights from these signals has , in recent days, led to a re-invention and re-imagination of using novel, custom as well as common wearables in delivering and improving care for orthopedic patients. The clinical utility of these is yet to be proven conclusively, but there is no doubt that unobtrusive wearable sensing will , in the very near future, take its place amongst routine orthopedic care, to enhance outcomes and facilitate good patient recovery even away from the hospitals.
